# dormant-whale-awakening-trap
A custom Drosera trap that detects dormant whales waking up with large transactions.
# Dormant Whale Awakening Trap 🐳⚠️

This Drosera trap detects suspicious large transactions from wallets that have been dormant for a long time — potentially signaling a wallet hack, scam, or major whale activity.

## 🛠 How It Works

- Monitors a hardcoded whale wallet address.
- Checks if it has been inactive for over 100 blocks.
- If a big transaction (>1 ETH) is detected after dormancy, it sends an on-chain alert.

## 📁 Key Files

- `src/Trap.sol`: The Trap logic contract.
- `src/AlertReceiver.sol`: Receives the alert from the trap.
- `drosera.toml`: Configuration file linking the trap, response contract, and metadata.
